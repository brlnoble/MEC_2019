# MEC_2019

The McMaster Engineering Competition (MEC) is an undergraduate competition open to students in engineering, computer science, and B-tech. My first year competing, and my team was challenged with the topic of sustainability. We were asked to create an autonomous robot that would sort between recycling and garbage, modeled as different coloured and shaped pieces of foam. These objects would have to be pushed to a zone on the right for garbage, and to a zone on the left for recycling. Restricted to six hours, and with a mock budget of $100, we had to be creative and efficient to complete the design. Ultimately, we used one reflective sensor and a single ultrasonic sensor to locate objects, check its colour through the reflective value, and then grab it and sort it to its proper side. 

The design worked very well, and my team placed 4th in the competition.
